# Code Quality Guardrails

## Avoid Over-Engineering
- Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary.
- Keep solutions simple and focused.
- Do not add features, refactor code, or make improvements beyond what was asked.
- A bug fix does not need surrounding cleanup.
- A simple feature does not need extra configurability.

## Documentation Discipline
- Do not add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you did not change.
- Only add comments where the logic is not self-evident.
- Prefer self-explanatory code over explanatory comments.

## Defensive Coding
- Do not add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that cannot happen.
- Trust internal code and framework guarantees.
- Only validate at system boundaries: user input, external APIs, file I/O, network.

## Abstractions
- Do not create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations.
- Do not design for hypothetical future requirements.
- The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task.

## General-Purpose Solutions
- Write high-quality, general-purpose solutions using standard tools.
- Do not create helper scripts or workarounds just to pass tests faster.
- Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs.
- Focus on implementing the actual logic that solves the problem generally.
- If the task is unreasonable, infeasible, or tests are wrong, say so instead of working around it.

## Self-Check
- Before finishing, verify the solution against the actual requirements, not just the tests.
- Tests verify correctness; they do not define the entire solution.
